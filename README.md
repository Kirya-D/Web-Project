# Web-Project
Dedicated pages for learning and understanding the basic building blocks of math: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The hommepage (index) merely provides a brief description of each which can also be found at the top of each corresponding page
At the bottom of the homepage is a link that brings you to the addition page, and each page has a similar link at the bottom leading to the next (addition to subtraction, subtraction to multiplating, and so on)

Each arithmetic page has 5 relatively simple questions that are randomized when the page is loaded and each question has a button option to reveal the answer
In addition to this there is a button at the bottom of the question list allowing you to generate another question (with no limit to the number of questions)

Website doesn't currently implement HTML elements which should have been implemented in earlier assignments because I shifted my website idea a few weeks after we started working on our projects.
Unimplemented HTML elements: Table, List, and Form
