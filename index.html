                            In math, addition is a fundamental operation that combines two or more numbers to find their total,
                            represented by the plus "+" sign, and the result is called the <b>sum</b>.

                            In math, subtraction is an operation representing the process of finding the difference between two numbers or quantities,
                            denoted by the minus "-" sign. It's the inverse operation of addition, where you're essentially taking away one number from another and the result is
                            called the <b>difference</b>.

                            Multiplication is essentially repeated addition where you add a number to itself a specific number of times,
                            represented by another number and the result is called the <b>product</b>.

                            In math, division is a fundamental operation that involves splitting a quantity into equal parts or determining how many
                            times one number is contained within another. It's the inverse of multiplication and is represented by the symbols "รท" or "/"
                            and the result is called the <b>quotient</b>.
                        </p>
